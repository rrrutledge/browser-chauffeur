"""Classify Workflow tool calls as auto-allowable.

Two independent paths can auto-allow a call:

1. A *saved* workflow (`tool_input.name` referencing a fixed, previously
   authored script — built-in or from `.claude/workflows/`) is blanket-trusted
   the same way `trusted_script_dirs` trusts a directory's contents rather than
   re-inspecting every run, via `workflow_blanket_names` in config. An
   inline/dynamic script's own self-declared `meta.name` is never consulted for
   this path — nothing in that text is proof of what the script actually does.

2. An inline/dynamic `script` (or a `scriptPath` file) is read and sent to
   `scripts.ask_ai_about_workflow_script`, mirroring the existing node/python
   file-script AI check. A workflow script has no filesystem/network access of
   its own — its only real-world effect is the prompts it hands to `agent()`,
   and once the call is approved every subagent it spawns runs unattended with
   full tool access. So the check reads those prompts and applies the same
   read-only-or-reversible standard used everywhere else in this hook.
