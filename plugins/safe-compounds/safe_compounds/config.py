"""Consumer configuration.

The plugin ships with no organization-specific data. A consumer supplies their
own trusted domains, MCP servers, commands, and script directories via a
machine-local JSON file (default ~/.claude/safe-compounds-config.json, or the
path in SAFE_COMPOUNDS_CONFIG_JSON).

Example ~/.claude/safe-compounds-config.json:
    {
      "trusted_commands": ["mycli"],
      "curl_domains": ["atlassian.net", "mycorp.sharepoint.com"],
      "mcp_blanket_servers": ["plugin_product-management_atlassian"],
      "mcp_blanket_tools": ["mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__apply_sensitive_message_label"],
      "trusted_script_dirs": ["my-plugins/"],
      "learned_sync_exclude": ["my-internal-cli"],
      "workflow_blanket_names": ["code-review"]
    }

Every value here is a command *name* or path/domain string — a name-level
allowlist, not a safety verdict. (The hook decides "safe" per command at
runtime; this file just feeds the lists those decisions draw on.)

All keys are optional; defaults are empty, which means "trust nothing extra"
(curl is then limited to localhost and read-only GETs, no MCP server is
blanket-allowed, etc.).

`trusted_commands` is your private/company trust — it is never promoted to the
shared PR. `learned_sync_exclude` blocklists additional command names that the
AI might learn but should never be shared publicly (e.g. an internal tool name).

`workflow_blanket_names` auto-allows Workflow tool calls by their saved
workflow name (`tool_input.name` — a built-in workflow or one saved under
`.claude/workflows/`). An inline/dynamic `script` payload is never
blanket-allowed via this list, however it names itself, since nothing in
that text is proof of what it does. Instead, an inline script is sent to
an AI safety check (`scripts.ask_ai_about_workflow_script`) that reads the
prompts it hands to `agent()` calls — the only thing such a script can
actually do — every time it runs, since the text differs run to run.

`mcp_blanket_tools` auto-allows individual MCP tool calls by their full
name (`mcp__<server>__<operation>`), regardless of what verb the operation
name starts with. Use this when one specific tool on a server is safe to
run unattended but the server as a whole isn't (e.g. a Gmail label/trash
tool whose effect is private and reversible, without blanket-trusting
every other Gmail tool too).
