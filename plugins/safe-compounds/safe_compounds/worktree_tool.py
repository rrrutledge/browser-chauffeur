"""Classify EnterWorktree and ExitWorktree tool calls as auto-allowable.

Creating a *new* worktree (no `path` given) always lands under
`.claude/worktrees/`, the EnterWorktree equivalent of `git worktree add`
there -- already a trusted git subcommand -- so this case is approved
unconditionally.

Switching into an *existing* worktree (`path` given) is always blocked
instead of approved, no matter where that path lives. Claude Code enforces
its own permission-root confirmation on any explicit-`path` EnterWorktree
call -- moving the session's working directory, write access, and project
config counts as a permission-root change, and per Claude Code's own docs
only `bypassPermissions` mode can suppress that prompt; no hook decision
can. So approving the call buys nothing -- the harness still asks -- while
blocking it lets the redirect message steer the model to a genuinely
prompt-free alternative: work the existing worktree without relocating into
it, via `git -C <path> <cmd>` for git operations and absolute paths under it
for Read/Write/Edit and other file tools. Neither of those touches the
permission root, so neither prompts. A path outside `.claude/worktrees/`
gets an extra first step in the same message: move it into convention with
`git worktree move` (already a trusted git subcommand, preserving the
branch and any uncommitted work) before working on it directly -- the same
self-correcting pattern used elsewhere in this hook (e.g. the
PowerShell-tool block pointing at Bash).

The one gap in that redirect: a command that genuinely needs its own
working directory to *be* the worktree (e.g. an `npm` script that relies on
relative paths) can't be expressed as `-C <path> <cmd>` or an absolute path,
and still needs a real relocation -- which still costs the one click.

ExitWorktree takes no path at all -- it only ever acts on the one worktree
this same session entered via EnterWorktree, tracked internally by the
harness, not supplied by the model. `action: "keep"` never deletes anything.
`action: "remove"` mirrors `git branch -d`'s safety contract: the tool
itself refuses when the worktree has uncommitted files or commits that
never made it onto the original branch, unless `discard_changes: true`
forces it through -- so plain removal is reversible (everything it deletes
is already preserved elsewhere) and only the `discard_changes` override,
which knowingly throws work away, needs a human.
