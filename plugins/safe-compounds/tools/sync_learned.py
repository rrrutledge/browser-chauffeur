"""Promote machine-local learned approvals into the plugin source via a PR.

Runs automatically at session end (wired in hooks/hooks.json) and on demand
(/safe-compounds:sync-learned). When the hook has learned new safe commands, it
records them in ~/.claude/safe-compounds-learned.json; this turns those into a
pull request so the learnings are shared instead of staying on one machine.

Design notes:
- It opens/updates the PR through the GitHub API (`gh api`), not local git, so it
  works from the installed plugin cache and never touches your working tree.
- It accumulates into one rolling branch/PR (BRANCH) — not one PR per session.
- It is best-effort: any failure (no `gh`, offline, not authed) is swallowed so
  it can never disrupt session end; the learnings stay local for next time.
- It is idempotent: each run rebuilds the branch as main + still-pending entries,
  and prunes entries that have already landed in main from the local store.
