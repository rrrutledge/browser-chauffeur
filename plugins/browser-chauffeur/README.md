# browser-chauffeur

**Stop wrestling with browser automation.** Just tell Claude what you need done on a website — browser-chauffeur handles the rest.

Claude becomes your personal browser chauffeur: you give directions, Claude drives. Navigate complex web apps, fill out forms, extract data, click through multi-step workflows — all through natural language. No more writing fragile Selenium scripts or fighting with selectors that break every deployment.

## Why browser-chauffeur?

- **Self-healing automation** — when something breaks (and it will), Claude doesn't give up. It reads diagnostic screenshots, figures out what changed, fixes the script, and retries. Overlays, UI updates, login redirects — handled automatically.
- **Two modes for any situation** — MCP Playwright tools for quick public-site tasks, or Node.js CDP scripts that connect to your existing browser session with all your logins intact. Corporate SSO? Already solved.
- **Zero selector guesswork** — Claude inspects the live page before every action, uses semantic selectors (roles, labels, text) instead of brittle CSS classes, and verifies each step succeeded before moving on.
- **Scripts that get better over time** — once a flow works, save it as a reusable script. When the UI changes, browser-chauffeur's recovery loop patches the script automatically.

## Prerequisite

Requires the **playwright MCP plugin**:

```
/plugin marketplace add playwright
/plugin install playwright@playwright-cli
```

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add rrrutledge/rrrutledge-claude-code-plugins
/plugin install browser-chauffeur@rrrutledge-plugins
```

## Usage

Just describe what you want to do on a website:

> "Use browser-chauffeur to go to [site] and [task]."

Or let Claude auto-invoke it when you describe a browser task.

## Skill trigger

Auto-invokes when you ask Claude to perform a task on a website — filling a form, clicking through a workflow, navigating a web app, or extracting information.
