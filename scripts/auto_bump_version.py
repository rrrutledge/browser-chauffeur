"""Post-merge automation: patch-bump every plugin whose code changed in this push.

The failure this prevents: a behavior change lands under plugins/<name>/ while
plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json keeps the same version, so
`claude plugin update` (which keys off the version number) never re-pulls the
new source and the fix silently never ships. Previously a CI guardrail (see git
history for check_version_bump.py) required every PR to bump the version by
hand — in practice that step was easy to forget and needed follow-up "bump to
X" PRs more than once. This script removes the manual step: it runs after a
push lands on main and bumps the patch version for any plugin that changed but
didn't already get a version bump in the PR.

For skill plugins the behavior IS markdown — skills/**/SKILL.md and
commands/*.md are the payload, not documentation. So a blanket "*.md is docs"
exemption would skip bumping exactly the changes that most need to ship.
The exemption is therefore narrow: only genuine meta-docs (README, CHANGELOG,
CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE) and anything under a docs/ directory are bump-exempt.

A plugin that already got a manual version change in the push (e.g. a
deliberate minor/major bump made in the PR) is left alone — only plugins whose
version is unchanged between before/after get an automatic patch bump.

Run after merge, as a push-to-main workflow step. Compares the pushed commits
against the pre-push state ($BEFORE_SHA, from the push event's `before` field).
Writes updated plugin.json files in place; the workflow commits and pushes them.
